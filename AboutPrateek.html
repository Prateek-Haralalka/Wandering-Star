 	<p>I'm currently living in Paris, France, and pursuing the MSc. in Digital Marketing & Data Science program at emlyon business school. <br> We recently took a course on Web Development, and were tasked with creating a website. <br> That seemed like the perfect opportunity to launch Wandering-Star.<br>
 	<br>
 	Writing about oneself isn't quite as easy as it initially seems. When you actually sit down to write, your mind goes blank. <br> You start to panic. You start to ask questions - lots of them. <br>
 	What if no one likes what I write? What if I come off as arrogant? What if....on and on. <br>
 	Anyhow, here goes...</p>

 		<h2>Me, The Person</h2>
 		<p> I have traveled extensively in Europe, staying in hostels and Airbnbs, and have had conversations I will forever cherish. Be it the mid-night hours I spent at a café in Marseille, drinking Moroccan mint tea and exchanging life stories with a Tunisian, an Algerian, a Senegalese, and a Moroccan, while all 5 of us waited for our early morning trains, or the German host who told me about her great-grandfather having served in the SS, and how the letters he wrote to his mother while he was away at war showed that he had become less sensitive over time, the interactions and experiences have been priceless. <br>
 			<br>
 		I particularly remember asking Maren, my German host, if she would vote for Angela Merkel (it was 2017, and Germany was headed for an election). Her reply was, “I may or may not have voted for her earlier, but now, I will. She let so many refugees into Germany. In Catholicism, one is taught to help those in need, and she did that. That is why I will vote for her." <br>
 		I will never forget it. <br>
  		<br>
  		In my spare time (of which there is never enough), I workout, read, watch videos of Roger Federer on YouTube - I'm pretty sure I've already watched EVERY.SINGLE.VIDEO. there is of him. <br>
 		I also like knowing stuff: Politics, Sports, Business, Entertainment, all of it. Mainly because I love having a good conversation. I believe, relationships are formed around shared laughs (and tears), meals and good conversations, not  emojis and memes. And knowing what's happening in the world, allows me to be able to connect with people. <br>
 		<br>
 		Movies - Oh! I absolutely love watching movies! Sunset Boulevard, The Apartment, Roman Holiday, Casablanca, Life is Beautiful, Schindler's List, Annie Hall, Midnight in Paris, I could go on and on and on.<br>
 		<br>
 		Since this is a blog and not my memoir, I think I'll stop here. But don't let that stop you from checking out the rest of the pages on Wandering-Star. And if you have any questions, just drop me a line. <br>
		I'd love to hear from you!
